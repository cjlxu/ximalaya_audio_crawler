# ximalaya audio crawler
This project is still in its infantly CP stage. I found many public codes published by others for crawling Ximalaya's audio data did not work actually. So I tried to find a workable way out by myself. Currentlyï¼Œ my way works, but the code is still quit raw and ugly. The reason why I open it is to share my idea with guys. If anybody think it is useful, that will make me very happy. 

If you meet any issue, your feedbacks are welcome. Good luck!

As a real lazy guy, I just use valid cookies in logging. You need to replace this part with you own sign-in logic.
